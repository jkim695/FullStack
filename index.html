      A sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, and a good night's sleep consists of
      5-6 sleep cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, you will feel groggy, even
      if you've completed several cycles prior to waking up.
    </p>
    <p>If you go to bed now, when should you wake up?</p>
